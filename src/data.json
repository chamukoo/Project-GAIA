    "description": "The Donkey’s tail is a succulent plant species that stores water for long periods of time as a fail-safe when in its natural habitat water becomes scarce. It can be grown outdoors as well as indoors during the summer and will in fact relish in the sun. Despite, Mexico having a much warmer climate than those of us in temperate regions, this plant has adjusted well and grows easily indoors. During winter, it is fine if the temperature drops down and it can encourage them to actually bloom in the forthcoming spring season. During the growing season from April – September, water the plant thoroughly and then water when the soil becomes dry to the touch. During winter, cut down on the watering, which the plant may only need once a month. You will only need to repot this plant during spring when the existing pot has become too small for it and use a shallow pot. Avoid wet or poorly drained conditions. Pest/disease problems can occur due to overwatering. Stems and leaves can be eaten, but when ingested in large quantities, can cause stomach upset. Like many succulents, it thrives best in full sun and prefers plenty of warm sun exposure. If you choose to keep your plant indoors, choose a sunny windowsill with several hours of daily light."

    "description": "Ball cactus is considered endangered in the wild. Its sparse populations grow in cool, dry temperate grasslands. This species is cultivated for horticultural purposes, and must be grown under glass in cold regions during the winter. Ball cactus is a drought-tolerant plant that does not require frequent watering. Water thoroughly when the soil is completely dry. When potted, water slowly, wait for water to flow out the bottom, and then pour the excess water from the tray to avoid water accumulation. Spring, summer, and fall are its growing seasons. Water once or twice a week to keep the soil slightly wet. In winter, water less; just keep the soil from drying excessively; usually once a week. Besides, water with rainwater or distilled water rather than tap water. Tap water contains a lot of calcium, magnesium, and other mineral salts. Long-term use tends to cause soil compaction. Avoid splashing water on its stem when watering to prevent rotting. Ball cactus is a heliophilic plant and needs sufficient sunlight for its growth and blooming. It can be placed on the outdoor balcony or in the garden without shade. However, long-time exposure to blazing sunlight should be avoided in hot summer, when it needs to be shaded or cooled a little to prevent high temperatures from damaging it. Ball cactus does not require much pruning. Remove withered flowers and branches so the plant uses nutrients on healthy growth."

Zebra plants don’t need much effort when it comes to watering, as then can still survive even without one for many weeks. They also look exceptionally beautiful in unusual containers or interesting soil mixes, making them perfect for any indoor spaces. Unlike any other succulents, Zebra plants do well even in medium and low light conditions, which is usually found in an indoor setting. But if you want to bring out its stunning red and orange pigments, display them in a spot where they can get as much natural light as possible, like a south or east-facing windowsill. They have very sensitive leaves, and exposing them to direct light will most likely lead them to get dry tips, which is their way of telling you that they are receiving too much sunlight. Watering Zebra plants is a bit tricky, as too much can quickly lead to root rot or discoloration, and too little water can cause the leaves to drop."

Panda Plants can grow quite large – up to 1.5 feet (45 cm) tall, growing into a shrub shape. You can also prune them to maintain more of a bush or tree-like shape. The fuzzy leaves are typically silvery-gray in color, edged with either a rust color on younger leaves or more of a rich chocolate brown on more mature leaves. Each leaf can grow up to 3 inches long. Panda Plants are well-suited to hot, dry environments. Their leaves are reflective, helping to minimize the risk of the plant overheating, plus their fuzzy coating helps reduce water vapor loss during transpiration. These things make the plant drought-resistant. This plant can produce fuzzy flowers when grown in the wild. However, it’s unusual for it to flower when kept indoors as a houseplant. They also aren’t frost-tolerant, so if they are kept outdoors then they should be moved indoors well before the winter cold sets in. The panda plant is a slow grower which will only need re-potting once every 2 years and then less once it matures. Leaf cuttings can be taken and planted in new soil during spring. Give the leaf cutting a week of drying out before re-potting, then you can expect them to begin rooting within 4 weeks. "

Leaves are fleshy, green with yellow edges and reddish-pink tints around the edges when exposed to sunlight. Flowers are small, star-shaped, pale yellow, and appear in summer. This plant is monocarpic, meaning it dies after flowering. Sunburst do not like hot or dry weather. Therefore, they may go dormant in summer and do not require any water except in arid conditions. In extreme heat, their leaves will curl to prevent excessive water loss. Growing them in moist shade will keep them growing, but their true growth season is winter to spring, when temperatures are cool, 65 to 75 °F. Like most types of succulents, the Sunburst has similar water needs. The plant should be watered regularly because of the plant’s small roots. However, we recommend that you thoroughly soak the plant in water and let it dry completely before watering again. For the summer the plant might lay dormant, and then it requires no water, except if the conditions are very dry. It thrives best in full sunlight to part sunlight in a sheltered spot, but the bright light enhances the rich hues of the darker sunburst. It can be easily propagated by seed or by stem cuttings. Take cuttings of rosettes in the spring and kept at 18ºC and barely moist until rooted."

Marjoram is one of those plants that seems to put all of its efforts into successful reproduction. It seeds easily, lends itself to division, reproduces via cuttings without fuss, and can even be layered. Marjoram is a very useful herb, as it keeps its full flavor even when dried. In order to dry marjoram, pick the leaves just after flower buds appear but before they open, removing no more than a third of the plant’s leaves in a single harvest. Once the leaves have dried, strip them from the stem. You may harvest again when flower buds reappear later in the season. Pruning flowering stems in summer will reduce the volume of flowers and seeds produced. You can also divide mature plants every few years to restrict the spreading root rhizomes and produce lots of free plants. Flower buds grow on apical and lateral extremities forming tight green knots opening into white flowers. Marjoram is often confused with its close cousin oregano. They are both from the genus Origanum in the mint family, Lamiaceae, but are completely different species; marjoram is Origanum majorana, and oregano is Origanum vulgare. The key differences between marjoram and oregano are their flowers and flavor. Marjoram flower buds open to white or purple florescences, whereas oregano flowers are pink."

A fast-growing plant, it yields many leaves in a short time in the mild weather of spring and fall. When growing spinach, the trick lies in making it last as long as possible, especially in the spring, when lengthening days shorten its life. Plant spinach during the cool weather of spring and fall. Space spinach plants 12 inches apart in fertile, well-drained soil. Check soil moisture often or consider using a soaker hose to keep moisture levels consistent. Harvest spinach starting with the outermost leaves once leaves are large enough to eat. Harvest by removing only the outer leaves and allowing the center leaves to grow larger; this will allow the plant to keep producing. Picking the outer leaves also gives the advantage of briefly delaying bolting. In spring, when plants are about to bolt, pull the entire plant at once to enjoy the leaves before they become bitter. In the spring, plants will grow tall and bloom, called bolting as soon as the days are longer than 14 hours. Heat also speeds up bolting, since spinach prefers temperatures between 35 and 75 degrees. Because it bolts in the lengthening days of spring, spinach is an especially popular crop for fall, when days are short and cool. Plants are very cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures as cold as the teens to low 20s once they are well established."
